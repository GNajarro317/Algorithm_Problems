Task
Given an unsorted array of integers, the objective is to find the smallest and largest integers in the array. The solution must operate in 𝑂(𝑛) time complexity and should not utilize any built-in Python functions to determine the minimum and maximum values.

Explanation
The code contains a single loop that iterates through the input list of integers. The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of integers in the input list.

It first checks if the input list is empty. If it is. Two variables min_val and max_val are initialized to positive and negative infinity. The function iterates through the list and updates min_val and max_val accordingly to find the minimum and maximum values. the function returns a tuple containing the minimum and maximum values found in the list.
