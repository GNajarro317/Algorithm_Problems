Task
Given an array of digits in the range [0, 9], the objective is to rearrange the elements to form two numbers such that their sum is maximized. The two numbers must have a digit count that differs by no more than one.

Explanation
The time complexity of the rearrange_digits function is dominated by the heapify operation, which has a time complexity of O(n log n) where n is the number of elements in the input list. The while loop iterates through the elements in the heap, which is also O(n). Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

It creates a max heap by negating each element in the input list and heapifying it using the heapq module. The function iterates over the heap. In each iteration, it pops the maximum element (negative of the original element) from the heap and constructs the two numbers by appending digits accordingly. It returns a tuple containing the two rearranged numbers.
