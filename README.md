### Project Title
Algorithm Efficiency Problems

### Description
In this project, I tackled seven algorithmic problems to assess my understanding of fundamental concepts. Each problem required writing clean and efficient Python code, accompanied by explanations of the code's efficiency and design choices. The focus was on implementing basic algorithms without relying on built-in functions.

The problems addressed included:

* Finding the square root of an integer without libraries.
* Searching for a target value in a rotated sorted array.
* Rearranging an array to form two numbers with a maximum sum.
* Sorting an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s in a single traversal.
* Finding the minimum and maximum values in an unsorted array.
* Implementing a Trie data structure for HTTP routing.

### Requirements
Python (version 3.12.1)
