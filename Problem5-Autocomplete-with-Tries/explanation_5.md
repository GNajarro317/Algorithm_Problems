Task
Implement a Trie (or Prefix Tree) in Python to store a dynamic set of strings. The Trie should facilitate operations such as word insertion and prefix searching, commonly used in predictive text and autocomplete features.

Explanation
The time complexity of the suffixes method in the TrieNode class is O(m), where m is the number of characters in the trie. This is because the method recursively traverses all the nodes in the trie to find all suffixes starting from the current node.

The Trie data structure is used for efficient retrieval of a key in a dataset of strings. It allows for quick lookups and prefix searches in a collection of strings.
TrieNode represents a node in the Trie data structure. It has attributes to store children nodes and a flag to indicate the end of a word. The insert method inserts a character into the trie by creating a new node if the character is not already present. The suffixes method finds all suffixes starting from the current node recursively. Trie class initializes the root node and provides methods to insert a word into the trie and find a prefix in the trie.
